# CETScoin

**CETS** stands for: Cryptocurrency Exchange Trading System. 

It is an attempt to extend the LETSystem for community-based mutual aid networks
in which people exchange all kinds of goods and services with one another, without the need for money.

Like other cryptocurrencies, CETScoin is generated by mining it. This is a new component within such trading systems. Anyone with a computer in the trading network is a potential miner. This role needs to be somehow 
incorporated into the exchange of goods.

Total available coins is: 18.446.744. Each block is mined every 2 minutes.

The best way to install CETScoin wallet is to compile it.
